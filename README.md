### Ilagrams - Replication of  https://ilagrams.com
  
This is my Third attempt to Replicating a website made with No-Code Technology i.e WordPress.
 
The original website <a href=" https://ilagrams.com"> Ilagrams.com </a> is an Old Students Association. I was able to practice new syntax like document onscroll amongst others.

I am so delighted with the way this one came out, it's so beautiful. I could say i got 9/10 for this.
